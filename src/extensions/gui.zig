//! this extension defines how a plugin will present it's gui. there are two
//! approaches:
//! 1. the plugin creates a window and embeds it into the host's window
//! 2. the plugin creates a floating window
//!
//! embedding the window gives more control to the host and feels more
//! integrated. floating windows are sometimes the only option due to technical
//! limitations.
//!
//! showing the gui works as following:
//! 1. `Plugin.isApiSupported`, check what can work
//! 2. `Plugin.create`, allocates gui resources
//! 3. if the plugin is floating
//!    -> `Plugin.setTransient`
//!    -> `Plugin.suggestTile`
//!    else, the plugin is not floating
//!    -> `Plugin.setScale`
//!    -> `Plugin.canResize`
//!    -> if resizable and has previously known size, `Plugin.setSize`
//!       else, `Plugin.getSize`
//!    -> `Plugin.setParent`
//! 4. `Plugin.show`
//! 5. `Plugin.hide`/`Plugin.show`...
//! 6. `Plugin.destroy` when done with the gui
//!
//! resizing the window (initiated by the plugin, if embedded):
//! 1. plugin calls `Host.requestResize`
//! 2. if that returns true the new size is accepted. the host does not have to
//!    call `Plugin.setSize`. if the host returns false the new size is rejected
//!
//! resizing the window (drag, if embeded):
//! 1. only possible if `Plugin.canResize` returns true
//! 2. mouse drag -> new_size
//! 3. `Plugin.adjustSize(new_size)` -> working_size
//! 4. `Plugin.setSize(working_size)`
